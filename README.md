This displays all the hospitals in Prince George's County, Maryland. The API for this project is https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/4juk-b4qs.json , which provided the longitude and latitude of all hospital facilities in the county. The API also provides a phone number and website url for each hospital. I used the Leaflet.js library in order to display a map on my website, which was meant to drop pins where the hospitals are located within the county. In any case of an emergency, all civilians in the area should know what hospital is closest to them.
